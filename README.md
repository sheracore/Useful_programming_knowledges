## Mocking

Mocking is primarily used in unit testing. An object under test may have dependencies on other (complex) objects. To isolate the behavior of the object you want to replace the other objects by mocks that simulate the behavior of the real objects. This is useful if the real objects are impractical to incorporate into the unit test.

In short, mocking is creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects.

## Concurrency
concurrency is not the same as parallel programming or parallelism because parallelism is about parallel execution and concurrency is a little bit more bacause concurrency is about designing your program as a collection of independent processes about designing these processes to eventually run in parallel
